# Object-Detection
Object Detection competition between Faster R-CNN and YOLO models

In this study, Alex and I tested the Faster R-CNN and YOLO models for Object Detectionâ€”a central problem in computer vision that is concerned with not only discerning the class of an object, but also discerning where the objects are located in an image. 

The primary objective of our experiment was to both qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the detection performance of the Faster R-CNN and YOLO models, which are two prominent neural network architectures for this task. Leveraging these popular neural network models, we conducted studies to evaluate their overall performance based on their object and boundary box classifications, as well as their total inference times.

Our results can be found in our report (Object_Detection), which includes our methodology, hypothesis, results, discussion, insights on the two models, and our comprehensive conclusion.
